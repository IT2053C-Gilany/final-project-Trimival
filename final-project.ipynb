    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> This dataset has a wide variety of motorcycle statistics, including many engine specifications.\n",
    "> This dataset lets me apply hobby grade knowledge to a real world application because of my interest in motorcycles.\n",
    "> Many questions can be answered using this dataset.\n",
    "> The dataset is very large, which is important when analyzing performance values.\n",
    "> The nature of the dataset will make a difficult skill more enjoyable to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, we can answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is engine torque a direct result of the engine displacement?\n",
    " - Value: Helps understand how these two major engine specs are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do motorcycles with more cylinders produce more horsepower on average?\n",
    " - Value: Shows whether engine configuration impacts power delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do motorcycles with higher power output tend to have wider rear tires?\n",
    " - Value: Useful for identifying how manufacturers match tire size to performance needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which engine configurations are the most common in the dataset?\n",
    " - Value: Shows which engine types trend the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between motorcycle weight and engine size?\n",
    " - Value: Reveals whether heavier motorcycles typically have larger engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "> To answer the questions above, I plan to create the following visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatterplot: Displacement (cc) vs Torque (Nm)\n",
    " - Insight: Shows whether engine displacement influences torque and how strong that relationship is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar Chart: Average Power (hp) grouped by Engine Cylinder count\n",
    " - Insight: Reveals how different cylinder configurations (1-cylinder, 2-cylinder, 4-cylinder, etc.) impact horsepower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatterplot: Power (hp) vs Rear Tire Width\n",
    " - Insight: Shows whether motorcycles with higher power output tend to use wider rear tires, which relates to traction and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histogram: Distribution of Power (hp)\n",
    " - Insight: Helps identify how horsepower is spread across the dataset and where most models fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatterplot: Weight (kg) vs Displacement (cc)\n",
    " - Insight: Shows whether heavier motorcycles tend to have larger engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boxplot: Power-to-Weight Ratio (hp per kg) grouped by Cylinder Count\n",
    " - Insight: Highlights differences in performance efficiency across engine types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotly Interactive Chart: Displacement vs Torque with hover details (cylinders, weight, model)\n",
    " - Insight: Allows stakeholders to explore individual motorcycle models interactively."
